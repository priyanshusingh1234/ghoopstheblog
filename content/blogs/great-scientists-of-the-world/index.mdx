# The Great Scientists of the World

Science has been the cornerstone of human advancement. Throughout history, there have been individuals whose groundbreaking work has changed the trajectory of humanity. Here’s a look at some of the most influential scientists of all time.

## 1. Albert Einstein

Albert Einstein, the father of modern physics, is best known for his **theory of relativity**. His famous equation `E=mc²` established the relationship between mass and energy, fundamentally transforming physics.

### Key Contributions:
- Theory of Special and General Relativity  
- Photoelectric Effect (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1921)  
- Mass-energy equivalence  

---

## 2. Isaac Newton

Isaac Newton revolutionized science with his laws of motion and universal gravitation. His book *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* laid the foundation for classical mechanics.

### Key Contributions:
- Three Laws of Motion  
- Universal Law of Gravitation  
- Development of Calculus  

---

## 3. Marie Curie

Marie Curie was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields: Physics and Chemistry.

### Key Contributions:
- Discovery of polonium and radium  
- Research on radioactivity  
- First female professor at the University of Paris  

---

## 4. Galileo Galilei

Galileo is often called the "father of modern science." He made significant discoveries in astronomy, physics, and motion, and supported the heliocentric model of the solar system.

### Key Contributions:
- Improvements to the telescope  
- Observations of Jupiter’s moons  
- Support for Copernican heliocentrism  

---

## 5. Charles Darwin

Charles Darwin fundamentally changed biology with his theory of evolution by natural selection. His book *On the Origin of Species* remains one of the most important scientific works ever written.

### Key Contributions:
- Theory of Evolution  
- Natural Selection  
- Foundation of modern evolutionary biology  

---

## 6. Nikola Tesla

Tesla was a brilliant inventor and electrical engineer known for his innovations in alternating current (AC) electricity and wireless communication.

### Key Contributions:
- Alternating Current (AC) system  
- Tesla Coil  
- Early work on wireless technology  

---

## 7. Stephen Hawking

Stephen Hawking made major contributions to cosmology and theoretical physics, particularly in the study of black holes and the nature of the universe.

### Key Contributions:
- Hawking radiation  
- Theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation  
- Author of *A Brief History of Time*
