## The Historical Origins of Yoga

Yoga is **more than just physical exercise** — it’s a holistic system for living.

- **Roots in Ancient India**: Traced back over **5,000 years**, yoga has deep ties to ancient Indian philosophy and culture.
- **Scriptural Mentions**: The earliest mention of yoga is in the **Rigveda** and later elaborated in the **Upanishads**, **Bhagavad Gita**, and **Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras**.

### Key Yogic Texts
