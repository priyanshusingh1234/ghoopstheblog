## 🤖 What Is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by **OpenAI**. It's based on a large language model (LLM) called **GPT-4**, which has been trained on a vast amount of text from the internet, books, and other sources.

It's designed to **generate human-like text**, answer questions, write essays, solve problems, and even create code.

> Simply put, ChatGPT is like having a personal assistant, tutor, and brainstorming partner — all rolled into one.

## 🧠 How Does ChatGPT Work?

ChatGPT uses a transformer-based architecture that predicts the next word in a sentence based on the context. Through reinforcement learning and human feedback, it becomes better at understanding prompts and providing useful responses.

The latest model, GPT-4o, supports:
- **Text**
- **Code**
- **Images**
- **Speech (via APIs)**

This makes it one of the most powerful AI tools in 2025.
