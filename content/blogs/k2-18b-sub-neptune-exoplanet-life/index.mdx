### 🛰 The Transit Method

The transit method is one of the most effective ways of finding exoplanets. The Kepler telescope monitored **over 150,000 stars** for tiny dips in brightness—each one potentially caused by a planet.

## 🌍 The Importance of the Habitable Zone

K2-18b orbits its red dwarf star **in the habitable zone**, sometimes called the **“Goldilocks Zone.”** It’s the sweet spot around a star where the temperature is not too hot and not too cold, potentially allowing liquid water to exist.

> Related: [Circumstellar Habitable Zone - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone)

This places K2-18b among a **rare group of planets**—ones where scientists believe life **could theoretically exist.**

---

## 💨 The Atmosphere: Water Vapor Discovery

In **September 2019**, a groundbreaking discovery was announced by scientists analyzing data from the **Hubble Space Telescope**. They detected **water vapor** in the atmosphere of K2-18b.

### Why This Is Important

Water vapor is a **key ingredient for life as we know it**. Finding it on a planet within the habitable zone is a significant leap in the search for life.

According to the University College London team, this is the **first time water has been detected in the atmosphere of a potentially habitable exoplanet**.

## ☀️ Host Star: K2-18

K2-18 is a **red dwarf star**, much smaller and cooler than our Sun. While these stars are known to emit **powerful solar flares**, they are also **long-lived**—making their planets promising candidates for habitability.

However, red dwarfs can also strip away atmospheres through intense radiation, making the detection of a thick atmosphere on K2-18b even more remarkable.
